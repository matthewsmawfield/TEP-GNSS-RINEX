<h2>4. Signal Characterization & Validation</h2>

<p>Detecting a signal is only the first step. Validating it requires rigorous characterization of its properties and systematic exclusion of alternative explanations. This section presents the battery of tests performed to assess the origin of the observed correlations.</p>

<h3>4.1 Directional Anisotropy Validation</h3>

<p>An important validation step for signal detection is the directional anisotropy analysis (Section 3.9). Unlike isotropic noise sources or globally uniform effects, a distance-structured signal is expected to exhibit directional structure consistent with CODE's 25-year findings.</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Addressing Statistical Inflation & Effective Degrees of Freedom</h4>
    <p>A legitimate concern in large-N studies is that the 713 million pair-samples (ALL_STATIONS filter) are not fully independent—each station participates in many pairs, potentially inflating t-statistics beyond their true significance. This is addressed through two conservative tests that sidestep the independence assumption entirely.</p>
    
    <h5>Conservative Test 1: Month-as-Sample</h5>
    <p>If each calendar month is treated as a single independent observation (discarding all within-month pair statistics), the E-W > N-S anisotropy is still detected in 36 of 36 months (100%) for the Multi-GNSS mode. Under a null hypothesis of random directional bias, this consistency has probability:</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; background: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px;">
        P = (0.5)<sup>36</sup> ≈ 1.5 × 10<sup>−11</sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>This p &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup> result uses only 36 effective samples—a 4.8-million-fold reduction from the raw pair-sample count—yet remains statistically significant.</p>

    <h5>Conservative Test 2: Filter Independence</h5>
    <p>The three station filtering methods (ALL_STATIONS, OPTIMAL_100, DYNAMIC_50) use overlapping but distinct station subsets. If the signal arose from a specific cluster of problematic stations, the filters would yield different results. Instead, all three converge to consistent correlation lengths (§3.4). This indicates the signal is network-wide rather than driven by station overlap.</p>

    <h5>Conservative Test 3: Distance Bias Audit</h5>
    <p>A critical potential confounder is distance distribution bias: if E-W pairs happened to be shorter on average than N-S pairs within the &lt;500 km bin, the higher coherence could be a simple distance effect. An audit of the distance distributions reveals the opposite: E-W pairs are on average <strong>13 km longer</strong> than N-S pairs (305 km vs 292 km). Since coherence decays with distance, this bias <em>suppresses</em> the E-W signal. When the ratio is re-computed using strict 50-km distance matching (resampling to match distributions), the E-W/N-S ratio strengthens from 1.033 to 1.041. Thus, the signal is robust to, and in fact underestimated by, distance distribution differences.</p>

    <h5>No "Garden of Forking Paths"</h5>
    <p>The 72 analysis combinations (4 modes × 3 filters × 6 metrics) represent an <em>exhaustive</em> grid of all reasonable processing options—not a selective search for significance. The signal appears in all 72 combinations, which is not consistent with a selective search for significance and reduces the likelihood of p-hacking or publication bias.</p>
</div>

<h3>4.2 Geomagnetic Control (Ionosphere Test)</h3>

<h4>4.2.1 Kp Stratification</h4>

<p>A major alternative hypothesis for long-range GNSS correlations is ionospheric activity. To test this, the dataset was stratified into "Quiet" (Kp &lt; 3) and "Storm" (Kp ≥ 3) days using real geomagnetic data from GFZ Potsdam (Kp index since 1932). The Kp = 3 threshold is the standard boundary in space physics literature between quiet and active geomagnetic conditions (Menvielle & Berthelier, 1991): Kp &lt; 3 represents magnetically quiet conditions, while Kp ≥ 3 indicates active to storm conditions with enhanced ionospheric disturbances. Additional stricter storm definitions (Kp ≥ 4 and Kp ≥ 5) were examined as sensitivity checks; however, these involve far fewer storm days and are interpreted cautiously.</p>

    <h4>Ionosphere Hypothesis: Unsupported</h4>
    <p>Key findings from real Kp data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>λ changes only slightly:</strong> Storm λ is only 3–4% shorter than quiet λ (MSC metrics)</li>
        <li><strong>Phase alignment changes little:</strong> Phase-alignment λ is typically stable at the percent level at the primary threshold (Kp &lt; 3 vs. Kp ≥ 3)</li>
        <li><strong>R² remains high:</strong> 0.95+ in both conditions—signal remains detectable</li>
        <li><strong>Physical interpretation:</strong> Storms add short-range ionospheric noise, slightly reducing apparent λ, while the inferred ~700–1,800 km correlation structure remains detectable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the signal were primarily ionospheric, storm conditions might be expected to increase correlation (enhanced ionospheric activity = stronger ionospheric correlations). Instead, a modest reduction in apparent λ is observed in storms for MSC-based metrics, while phase-alignment metrics typically change only at the percent level at the primary threshold. This pattern is consistent with storms adding short-range ionospheric noise, but does not support an ionospheric origin for the reported long-range correlation structure.</p>

<h3>4.3 Null Tests</h3>

<h4>4.3.1 Clock Drift as Internal Consistency Check</h4>

<div>
    <p>The clock drift metric (time derivative of clock bias) serves as an internal consistency check. Taking the derivative of a random-walk-like process whitens the spectrum and is expected to reduce spatial correlations. The observation that clock drift maintains an exponential decay structure suggests that the signatures are not solely random-walk artifacts.</p>

    </table>
    
    <p>Conclusion: The preservation of spatial correlation in the derivative suggests that the signal is not due to static offsets or random walks. The signal represents dynamic, spatially-correlated fluctuations.</p>
</div>

<h4>4.3.2 Shuffled Data Null Test</h4>

<div>
    <p>A key validation test addresses the question: <em>"Does the methodology itself create artificial exponential decay?"</em> To test this, the coherence values were shuffled randomly across all distance bins, breaking any genuine distance-coherence relationship while preserving the exact same binning, fitting, and weighting procedures.</p>
    
    <h5>Methodology</h5>
    <p>The shuffled null test randomly permutes the coherence values across all station pairs, destroying any physical distance-dependence while preserving:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identical log-spaced distance binning (40 bins, 50–13,000 km)</li>
        <li>Identical bin mean calculation</li>
        <li>Identical weighted exponential fitting</li>
        <li>Identical R² assessment</li>

        <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 13px; margin-top: 8px;"><strong>Figure:</strong> Left: Real data shows clear exponential decay. Right: Shuffled data shows flat coherence across all distances. The methodology reveals existing structure; it does not create artificial decay.</p>
    </div>
    -->
    
    <h5>Implications</h5>
    <p>If log-binning or exponential fitting created artificial decay, the shuffled data would also show exponential decay. <em>It does not.</em> This supports the interpretation that the observed structure depends on the specific relationship between coherence and physical separation. Destroying the spatial topology destroys the signal, which is consistent with a genuine geometric property of the GNSS network.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log-spaced binning does not transform Y-values — it only groups data</li>
        <li>The exponential model cannot fit flat data with high R²</li>
        <li>The decay observed in real data is a property of the data, not the analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This supports the interpretation that the exponential decay is a property of the data, not a methodological artifact.</p>
</div>

<h4>4.3.3 Multi-Metric Discrimination</h4>

<div>
    <p>If the methodology artificially created exponential decay, all metrics would show identical correlation lengths. Instead, different metrics show distinctly different λ values:</p>

            <td>Position Jitter</td>
            <td>883</td>

            <td>0.974</td>
            <td>Derivative preserves structure</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Key observation: The ionofree mode shows λ = 1,072 km, which is 47% longer than baseline (727 km). Removing ionospheric effects increases the correlation length because ionospheric decorrelation was shortening the apparent λ. An artificial methodology effect would not "know" to respond this way to ionospheric correction. This physically meaningful response is consistent with a real signal rather than a fitting artifact.</p>

    <p>None of the known systematic effects produce correlation lengths in the observed range across all processing modes. The observed scales are consistent with TEP predictions, especially for phase alignment metrics which reach 3,485 km in ionofree mode.</p>

<h3>4.5 Time Alignment Validation</h3>

<div>
    <h4>The "Time Slip" Problem and Its Solution</h4>
    
    <p>A critical validation step was verifying that the Pandas DatetimeIndex alignment method correctly handles missing data. Without proper alignment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Missing days cause cumulative "time slips"</li>
        <li>Station pairs become desynchronized</li>
        <li>Coherence artificially degrades</li>
        <li>Exponential decay becomes spuriously steep</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Validation: The agreement between raw SPP results (using Pandas DatetimeIndex alignment) and precise-product results (using the same methodology in Papers 1 and 2) supports the alignment approach.</p>

    <p>Interpretation: The agreement between completely independent processing pipelines provides strong evidence that the TEP signal is a physical phenomenon, not a processing artifact.

    <h5>Why This Is Not Circular Reasoning</h5>
    <p>A common concern with cross-validation is circularity: is this just comparing results to themselves? This is not the case here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary evidence requires no correction:</strong> The core finding—E-W > N-S at short distances (&lt;500 km)—uses raw, uncorrected values and matches CODE's prediction directly. The geometric suppression analysis (§3.9.4) is secondary validation only, explaining long-distance λ inversions</li>
        <li><strong>Different data:</strong> CODE products are network-adjusted; RINEX/SPP is purely local</li>
        <li><strong>Different processing:</strong> CODE uses IGS analysis centers; RTKLIB is independent</li>
        <li><strong>Different time periods:</strong> 25-year vs 3-year (mostly non-overlapping stations)</li>
        <li><strong>Results are not tuned:</strong> Raw RINEX results are reported as computed; comparison is post-hoc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CODE reference values are used only for interpreting secondary full-distance results, never to adjust or tune the primary short-distance evidence. The short-distance finding (E-W > N-S at &lt;500 km) is fully independent and requires no external calibration.</p>

<p>The convergence of these independent tests supports the interpretation that the observed exponential decay reflects a distance-dependent correlation structure in the data, not a methodological artifact.</p>
