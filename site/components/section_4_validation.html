<h1>4. Signal Characterization & Validation</h1>

<p>Detecting a signal is only the first step. Validating it requires rigorous characterization of its properties and systematic exclusion of alternative explanations. This section presents the battery of tests performed to confirm the origin of the observed correlations.</p>

<h2>4.1 Directional Anisotropy Validation</h2>

<p>The most stringent validation of TEP detection comes from the directional anisotropy analysis (Section 3.9). Unlike isotropic noise sources or globally uniform effects, a genuine TEP signal should exhibit specific directional structure matching CODE's 25-year findings.</p>

    <h3>Addressing Statistical Inflation & Effective Degrees of Freedom</h3>
    <p>A legitimate concern in large-N studies is that the 172 million station pairs are not fully independent—each station participates in many pairs, potentially inflating t-statistics beyond their true significance. This is addressed through two conservative tests that sidestep the independence assumption entirely.</p>
    
    <h4>Conservative Test 1: Month-as-Sample</h4>
    <p>If each calendar month is treated as a single independent observation (discarding all within-month pair statistics), the E-W > N-S anisotropy is still detected in <strong>36 of 36 months</strong> (100%) for the Multi-GNSS mode. Under a null hypothesis of random directional bias, this consistency has probability:</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; background: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px;">
        P = (0.5)<sup>36</sup> ≈ 1.5 × 10<sup>−11</sup>
    </p>
    
    <p>This p &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup> significance uses only 36 effective samples—a 4.8-million-fold reduction from the raw pair count—yet remains decisive.</p>

    <h4>Conservative Test 2: Filter Independence</h4>
    <p>The three station filtering methods (ALL_STATIONS, OPTIMAL_100, DYNAMIC_50) use overlapping but distinct station subsets. If the signal arose from a specific cluster of problematic stations, the filters would yield different results. Instead, all three converge to identical correlation lengths with <strong>zero variance</strong> (σ² = 0, §3.4). This confirms the signal is network-wide, not driven by station overlap.</p>

    <h4>No "Garden of Forking Paths"</h4>
    <p>The 54 analysis combinations (3 modes × 3 filters × 6 metrics) represent an <em>exhaustive</em> grid of all reasonable processing options—not a selective search for significance. The signal appears in <strong>all 54 combinations</strong>, ruling out p-hacking or publication bias.</p>
</div>

<h2>4.2 Geomagnetic Control (Ionosphere Test)</h2>

<h3>4.2.1 Kp Stratification</h3>

<p>The most significant alternative hypothesis for long-range GNSS correlations is ionospheric activity. To test this, the dataset was stratified into "Quiet" (Kp &lt; 3) and "Storm" (Kp ≥ 3) days using real geomagnetic data from GFZ Potsdam (Kp index since 1932).</p>

    <h3>Ionosphere Hypothesis: Unsupported</h3>
    <p>Key findings from real Kp data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>λ nearly invariant:</strong> Storm λ is only 3–4% shorter than quiet λ (MSC metrics)</li>
        <li><strong>Phase alignment robust:</strong> Δλ &lt; 1% for phase alignment metrics</li>
        <li><strong>R² remains excellent:</strong> 0.95+ in both conditions—signal persists, not destroyed</li>
        <li><strong>Physical interpretation:</strong> Storms add short-range ionospheric noise, slightly reducing apparent λ, but the underlying ~700–1,800 km correlation structure is preserved</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the signal were ionospheric, storm conditions would increase correlation (enhanced ionospheric activity = stronger ionospheric correlations). Instead, the opposite is observed: storms degrade the signal slightly. This confirms the correlations are not ionospheric in origin. The signal survives the most stringent environmental stress test available: geomagnetic storms inject substantial electromagnetic noise into the ionosphere, yet the underlying correlation structure remains intact.</p>

<h2>4.3 Null Tests</h2>

<h3>4.3.1 Clock Drift as Internal Consistency Check</h3>

<div>
    <p>The clock drift metric (time derivative of clock bias) serves as a powerful null test. Taking the derivative of a random walk process whitens the spectrum and destroys spatial correlations. The fact that clock drift maintains exponential decay structure demonstrates that these signatures are not random-walk artifacts.</p>

    <p>Conclusion: The preservation of spatial correlation in the derivative suggests that the signal is not due to static offsets or random walks. The signal represents dynamic, spatially-correlated fluctuations.</p>
</div>

<h3>4.3.2 Shuffled Data Null Test</h3>

<div>
    <p>A key validation test addresses the question: <em>"Does the methodology itself create artificial exponential decay?"</em> To test this, the coherence values were shuffled randomly across all distance bins, breaking any genuine distance-coherence relationship while preserving the exact same binning, fitting, and weighting procedures.</p>
    
    <h4>Methodology</h4>
    <p>The shuffled null test randomly permutes the coherence values across all station pairs, destroying any physical distance-dependence while preserving:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identical log-spaced distance binning (40 bins, 50–13,000 km)</li>
        <li>Identical bin mean calculation</li>
        <li>Identical weighted exponential fitting</li>
        <li>Identical R² assessment</li>
    </ul>

    -->
    
    <h4>Implications</h4>
    <p>If log-binning or exponential fitting created artificial decay, the shuffled data would also show exponential decay. <em>It does not.</em> This confirms that the signal is topological: it exists only in the specific relationship between coherence and physical separation. Destroying the spatial topology destroys the signal, confirming it is a genuine geometric property of the GNSS network.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log-spaced binning does not transform Y-values — it only groups data</li>
        <li>The exponential model cannot fit flat data with high R²</li>
        <li>The decay observed in real data is a property of the data, not the analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This confirms that the exponential decay is a property of the data, not a methodological artifact.</p>
</div>

<h3>4.3.3 Multi-Metric Discrimination</h3>

<div>
    <p>If the methodology artificially created exponential decay, all metrics would show identical correlation lengths. Instead, different metrics show distinctly different λ values:</p>

            <td>0.974</td>
            <td>Derivative preserves structure</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Key observation: The ionofree mode shows λ = 1,072 km, which is 47% longer than baseline (727 km). Removing ionospheric effects increases the correlation length because ionospheric decorrelation was shortening the apparent λ. An artificial methodology effect would not "know" to respond this way to ionospheric correction. This physically meaningful response confirms the signal is real.</p>

<h2>4.5 Time Alignment Validation</h2>

<div>
    <h3>The "Time Slip" Problem and Its Solution</h3>
    
    <p>A critical validation was confirming that the Pandas DatetimeIndex alignment method correctly handles missing data. Without proper alignment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Missing days cause cumulative "time slips"</li>
        <li>Station pairs become desynchronized</li>
        <li>Coherence artificially degrades</li>
        <li>Exponential decay becomes spuriously steep</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Validation: The agreement between raw SPP results (using Pandas DatetimeIndex alignment) and precise-product results (using the same methodology in Papers 1 and 2) confirms the alignment approach is correct.</p>

    <p>Interpretation: The agreement between completely independent processing pipelines provides strong evidence that the TEP signal is a physical phenomenon, not a processing artifact. The raw SPP ratios are lower due to GPS orbital geometry suppression of E-W baselines, but once this geometric effect is accounted for, the underlying anisotropy matches CODE's 25-year result.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Why This Is Not Circular Reasoning</h4>
    <p>A common concern with cross-validation is circularity: is this just comparing results to themselves? This is not the case here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary evidence requires no correction:</strong> The core finding—E-W > N-S at short distances (&lt;500 km)—uses raw, uncorrected values and matches CODE's prediction directly. The geometric suppression analysis (§3.9.4) is secondary validation only, explaining long-distance λ inversions</li>
        <li><strong>Different data:</strong> CODE products are network-adjusted; RINEX/SPP is purely local</li>
        <li><strong>Different processing:</strong> CODE uses IGS analysis centers; RTKLIB is independent</li>
        <li><strong>Different time periods:</strong> 25-year vs 3-year (mostly non-overlapping stations)</li>
        <li><strong>Results are not tuned:</strong> Raw RINEX results are reported as computed; comparison is post-hoc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CODE reference values are used only for interpreting secondary full-distance results, never to adjust or tune the primary short-distance evidence. The short-distance finding (E-W > N-S at &lt;500 km) is fully independent and requires no external calibration.</p>
