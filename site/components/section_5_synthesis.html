<h2>5. Synthesis: The Convergence of Evidence</h2>

<p class="intro-text">
    This paper serves as the third and final component of the TEP-GNSS validation framework. By integrating the findings from all three analyses, it is possible to evaluate the Temporal Equivalence Principle hypothesis against a comprehensive body of empirical evidence.
</p>

<h3>5.1 The Three-Pillar Validation Framework</h3>

<p>The empirical assessment is organized around a "Three-Pillar" validation framework. Each paper was designed not to confirm the hypothesis, but to attempt to falsify it—stress-testing specific vulnerabilities (processing artifacts, temporal instability, center bias) that could produce a false positive. If the signal were spurious, one would expect at least one of these independent tests to fail; the results reported here do not show such a failure:</p>

<h3>5.2 Directional Anisotropy: A Key Validation Test</h3>

<p>A key test of TEP is the directional anisotropy analysis—testing whether E-W and N-S correlations differ as predicted.</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Paper 3 (Raw SPP)</td>
            <td>1.80–1.86</td>

            <td>Same directional polarity</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>The convergence of directional structure across independent methodologies is noteworthy. The raw SPP analysis indicates E-W > N-S with t-statistics up to 112 and nominal p-values &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup> under the standard null. A critical distance audit indicates this is not an artifact: E-W pairs are 13 km longer than N-S pairs (suppressing the signal), and robust distance-matching strengthens the coherence ratio from 1.033 to 1.041.</p>

<div class="callout callout-success">
    <h4>Monthly Temporal Stability: A Consistency Test</h4>
    <p>The directional anisotropy was computed independently for each of the 36 months (Jan 2022 – Dec 2024). Across all processing modes and metrics:</p>
    <div class="callout callout-warning" style="margin: 15px 0;">
    <h4>Key point: the signal is constant, but the screening is not</h4>
    <p>Monthly short-distance E-W/N-S ratios show:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>E-W &gt; N-S in 94–100% of months (worst case 34/36)</li>
        <li>Coefficient of variation: 0.7–1.0% (coherence) and 3–6% (phase alignment)—essentially constant</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This pattern is not readily explained by temporal averaging, seasonal aggregation, or statistical fluctuation alone, and it is observed across the full 2022–2024 interval.</p>
    <p>Key distinction: The low CV of short-distance ratios is compatible with the orbital velocity coupling (r = −0.509 to −0.763) in §3.10, because these measure different quantities: short-distance ratios capture the short-baseline directional signature, while full-distance λ ratios include atmospheric screening effects that modulate annually. This complementarity is consistent with the "Screened Signal Model" (§3.7.5).</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        Interpretation: If the signal were ionospheric, it would be expected to be reduced or absent in ionofree mode. If it were GPS-specific, it would be expected to be absent in multi-GNSS. The persistence across all modes, with the highest ratio in multi-GNSS, is consistent with the phenomenon being neither predominantly ionospheric nor constellation-dependent.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>5.4 Consistency of Form vs. Scale</h3>

<p>A rigorous synthesis must address both the similarities and differences in the observed signals.</p>

<h4>5.4.1 The Common Signature</h4>
<p>Across all studies, two features are consistently preserved:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Exponential decay form ($C(r) \propto e^{-r/\lambda}$) with R² &gt; 0.90</li>
    <li>Directional asymmetry (E-W &gt; N-S) in the same polarity</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.4.2 The Scale Discrepancy</h4>
<p>The characteristic length scale ($\lambda$) varies between methodologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Precise Products (Papers 1 &amp; 2): $\lambda \approx 1,500 - 2,000$ km</li>
    <li>Raw SPP (Paper 3): $\lambda \approx 700 - 900$ km (MSC), $\lambda \approx 1,600 - 2,100$ km (phase alignment)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    One plausible contributor to this discrepancy is ionospheric masking. The baseline SPP mode (λ = 727 km, MSC) includes ionospheric effects that add short-range correlation, which can mask longer-range structure. When ionospheric effects are removed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ionofree MSC: λ increases to 1,073 km (+48%)</li>
    <li>Ionofree Phase Alignment: λ reaches 3,485 km — matching precise products</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The convergence of ionofree phase alignment (3,485 km) with precise-product analyses (~1,500–2,000 km) suggests that the same underlying correlation structure may be probed at different levels of atmospheric contamination. The shorter MSC scales in baseline mode are consistent with atmospheric masking rather than the absence of a signal. Across methodologies, the same directional polarity (E-W &gt; N-S) is observed.
</p>

<h3>5.4.3 Regional Control Tests: Quantitative Validation (Step 2.1a)</h3>
<p>
    The regional control tests provide quantitative validation. When the network is split into Global, Europe-only, Non-Europe, and hemisphere-specific subsets, the following is observed:

        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>The Southern Hemisphere Enhancement — Observed Pattern</h4>
    <p>A notable regional result is the Southern Hemisphere's systematically longer MSC correlation length:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Southern λ = 1,315 km vs Northern λ = 688 km (1.91× ratio)</li>
        <li>This is broadly consistent with CODE longspan (Paper 2): Southern orbital coupling r = −0.79 (p = 0.006) vs Northern r = +0.25</li>
        <li>Multiple lines of analysis are consistent with enhanced sensitivity in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., CODE orbital coupling, CMB frame analysis, and RINEX phase alignment)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One interpretation is that the Southern Hemisphere's sparser IGS network (106 vs 238 stations) produces fewer short baselines where local atmospheric noise dominates, which can improve sensitivity to longer-range structure.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>The Europe Anomaly as a Negative Control</h4>
    <p>The Europe-only subset serves as a useful <em>negative control</em>. If the TEP-related structure is long-range (λ ≈ 1,000+ km), it may be difficult to resolve in a network dominated by short baselines (&lt;200 km) where tropospheric turbulence contributes strong local correlations. Furthermore, Europe's specific geometry can reduce sensitivity to an east–west dominated anisotropy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Density masking: Europe's dense network produces many short baselines (&lt;200 km) for every long baseline, which can overweight the fit toward local tropospheric correlations.</li>
        <li>Directional bias: The European network is elongated North-South (Scandinavia to Italy, ~3,500 km) but narrow East-West (~1,500 km). Since the TEP signature is anisotropic (strongest E-W, suppressed N-S due to orbital geometry), Europe can preferentially sample the <em>suppressed</em> direction.</li>
        <li>Fit dominated by short-range structure: Europe Position Jitter/MSC achieves R² = 0.998, consistent with a fit dominated by <em>atmospheric</em> correlation (~500 km scale), which can obscure longer-range structure.</li>
        <li>Conclusion: The reduced long-range signature in Europe, compared with sparser regions, is consistent with the expectation that network geometry and baseline distribution modulate sensitivity to long-range structure. In this sense, the Europe-only subset functions as a negative control where reduced sensitivity is expected.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>5.5 Orbital Velocity Coupling</h2>

<p>A key TEP prediction is that directional anisotropy should modulate with Earth's orbital velocity. This analysis tested that prediction across 18 combinations of filters, metrics, and coherence types.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">TEP predicts coupling in <em>spacetime</em>, not just temporal effects. If the signal were a purely temporal clock artifact (e.g., oscillator thermal effects), it would be expected to propagate into position solutions with specific geometric projections rather than with near 1:1 magnitude scaling. The observed near-unity coupling (Δr ≈ 5%) is consistent with a shared underlying contribution affecting both observables (e.g., a perturbation to the spacetime interval ds²) rather than a parameter-specific error. Among the tested combinations, multi-GNSS pos_jitter yields r = −0.610 (4.0σ), and phase alignment reaches r = −0.763 (5.4σ).</p>

    <h3>Independent Replication of CODE Findings</h3>
    <p>The RINEX analysis provides an <em>independent replication</em> of CODE's 25-year planetary event findings using a completely different data source (raw RINEX vs. processed products), time period (2022–2024 vs. 2000–2025), and processing methodology (SPP vs. PPP). Key consistencies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detection rate: 59–68% (RINEX) vs. 35.9% (CODE) — both well above ~20% null</li>
        <li>No tidal mass scaling: no consistent GM/r² dependence is observed. Clock-amplitude vs GM/r² is non-significant (p = 0.647), σ-level vs GM/r² is non-significant across channels (p = 0.317–0.989), and one |coherence modulation| anticorrelation appears in clock_bias/phase (p = 0.0099), opposite the tidal expectation and not reproduced across other metrics</li>
        <li>Mean σ level: 2.5–4.3 (RINEX) vs. ~2.5 (CODE) — the year-specific method yields higher mean σ in raw SPP data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The absence of GM/r² scaling is consistent with TEP predictions: planetary alignments modulate phase correlation structure (geometric effect) rather than producing classical gravitational amplitude perturbations (which are removed in processing).</p>

    <p>At the primary Kp threshold (Kp &lt; 3 vs. Kp ≥ 3), phase alignment typically changes at only the percent level across modes. In ionofree processing, several metrics show slight positive Δλ during storms, contrasting with what would be expected if the signal were purely electromagnetic:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>If electromagnetic: Storms would inject noise, reducing λ (negative Δλ)</li>
        <li>Observed: Storms slightly enhance λ in ionofree mode (positive Δλ)</li>
        <li>Interpretation: Geomagnetic storms may reduce atmospheric turbulence that normally masks the gravitational correlation structure</li>
    </ul>

<h3>5.7.2 Seasonal Stability: The "Three Signatures" Framework</h3>

<p>To test whether the signal is a seasonal artifact, the analysis stratified the 3-year dataset by meteorological season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) and analyzed correlation lengths independently for each period. This produced 48 independent seasonal measurements (4 seasons × 3 filters × 4 modes) for each metric/coherence combination.</p>

    <p>Key insight: the observed seasonality can be interpreted as atmospheric screening of a baseline signal:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Inferred long-range component: Intrinsic scale ~6000 km (seen in OPTIMAL_100/Ionofree/Summer)</li>
        <li>Atmospheric Screen: Reduces effective λ by ~60–70% (from 6000 km to ~1800 km)</li>
        <li>Observable result: A baseline scale of ~1800 km is consistently observed, while the larger extent (~6060 km) is most apparent when screening is reduced</li>
    </ul>
