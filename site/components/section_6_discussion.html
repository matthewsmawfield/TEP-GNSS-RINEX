<h2>6.1 Significance of Raw Data Detection</h2>

<p>The detection of directionally-structured correlations in raw RINEX observations, processed with only Single Point Positioning and broadcast ephemerides, constitutes a critical methodological test for TEP. Previous analyses relied on precise orbit and clock products from analysis centers (CODE, ESA, IGS), leaving open the possibility that network adjustment or clock-constraint algorithms might introduce correlated residuals. By recovering the same exponential decay form and directional anisotropy using only raw observations and broadcast ephemerides, this analysis provides strong evidence that the signal is a property of the underlying physical measurements, not an artifact of precise-product generation.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The Processing Artifact Hypothesis — Addressed</h3>
    <p>Critics of Papers 1 and 2 could reasonably argue that the sophisticated algorithms used by CODE, ESA, and IGS to generate precise products might inadvertently create correlated residuals. These algorithms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network adjustment with inter-station constraints</li>
        <li>Reference frame alignment procedures</li>
        <li>Common ionospheric and tropospheric models</li>
        <li>Clock constraint strategies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By detecting exponential decay signatures <em>and</em> the directional anisotropy pattern using only raw observations and broadcast ephemerides, this paper provides strong evidence against the processing artifact hypothesis. The E-W/N-S ratio of 1.033–1.050, matching CODE's directional signature, cannot be explained by processing artifacts.</p>

        <h4>Why Tropospheric Weather Is Not the Cause</h4>
        <p>A potential objection is that the short-distance E-W anisotropy simply reflects prevailing weather patterns (Westerlies). This is ruled out by four facts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Orbital Coupling:</strong> Weather does not modulate with Earth's orbital velocity (r = −0.548 to −0.752, 3.5–5.3σ).</li>
            <li><strong>Ionofree Persistence:</strong> The signal becomes <em>stronger</em> and <em>longer-ranged</em> (λ = 6112 km) when ionospheric delay is removed. Tropospheric delay is non-dispersive and would not be selectively enhanced by ionofree combination.</li>
            <li><strong>CMB Alignment:</strong> Weather patterns do not align with the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole (19.3° separation, p &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>) (Burde, 2016; Consoli & Pluchino, 2021).</li>
            <li><strong>Ionospheric Gradient Scale:</strong> Lee & Lee (2019) show ionospheric spatial gradients are &lt;0.01 TECU/km under quiet conditions—far smaller than the effect observed here, which persists across all geomagnetic conditions.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>6.2 Physical Implications</h2>

<h3>6.2.1 Space-Time Coupling Supported</h3>

<p>The comparable correlation lengths for position jitter (spatial proxy, λ = 883 km) and clock bias (temporal proxy, λ = 727 km) confirm the fundamental TEP prediction: spatial and temporal fluctuations are coupled. The similar scales (within 21%) demonstrate that the same underlying mechanism affects both space and time measurements.</p>

<p>New evidence from orbital coupling analysis: Position jitter and clock bias show similar orbital velocity coupling (baseline: r = −0.526 vs −0.548, difference of 4%; multi_gnss: r = −0.659 vs −0.581, difference of 13%). This near-unity spacetime symmetry provides direct evidence that TEP affects both spatial and temporal measurements—a prediction unique to spacetime coupling theories. Multi-GNSS pos_jitter/phase achieves the strongest detection at r = −0.752, 5.3σ.</p>

<h3>6.2.2 Directional Anisotropy as Physical Signature</h3>

<p>The detected E-W/N-S anisotropy ratio of 1.033–1.050 (raw) and 1.79–1.86 (geometry-corrected) provides a unique physical fingerprint. This directional signature:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Matches CODE's 25-year finding (ratio 2.16)</li>
    <li>Cannot be explained by isotropic noise sources</li>
    <li>Persists across all processing modes and geomagnetic conditions</li>
    <li>Appears in both hemispheres with the same polarity</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2.3 CMB Frame Alignment: A Cosmic Reference</h3>

<p>The comprehensive 54-combination CMB frame analysis reveals that the annual modulation of EW/NS anisotropy aligns with the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole—the frame defined by Earth's motion (370 km/s) through the cosmic rest. This represents the most rigorous test of cosmic frame alignment yet performed on raw GNSS data.</p>

<div>
    <h4>Physical Implications of CMB Alignment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Best-fit RA = 157°, Dec = +9°</strong>, only 19.3° from CMB dipole (168°, −7°)—matching CODE's 25-year benchmark of 18.2°</li>
        <li><strong>78% RA clustering</strong>: Of 36 clean (non-Ionofree) combinations, 28 find RA within 10° of CMB (p &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>, >10σ)</li>
        <li><strong>Three exact matches at RA = 168°</strong> (probability 1 in 46.7 million, 6.4σ equivalent)</li>
        <li><strong>Solar Apex Strongly Disfavored</strong> at 106° separation (5.5× farther than CMB, 32× worse variance explained)</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-variance filter independence</strong>: All three station filters converge to same RA (CV = 0.3%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CMB frame is unique—it is the only reference frame that can be defined without appeal to local matter distribution. It represents the "absolute rest" frame of the universe, in which the average motion of all matter since the Big Bang is zero (Burde, 2016; Consoli & Pluchino, 2021). Burde (2016) develops a theoretical framework for special relativity consistent with a CMB preferred frame, while Consoli & Pluchino (2021) show that the CMB dipole anisotropy is a Doppler effect from Earth's 370 km/s motion through this fundamental rest frame Σ. If TEP describes velocity-dependent spacetime coupling, this is precisely the expected reference frame. The strong rejection of the Solar Apex (representing local galactic motion at 20 km/s) implies the effect is cosmological, not local.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Theoretical Resolution: Bi-Metric Geometry & Local Invariance</h4>
    <p>The apparent conflict with standard Lorentz invariance is resolved within the Bi-Metric Geometry framework detailed in the companion theory paper (<em>Smawfield, 2025, TEP theory preprint</em>). The theory postulates that while matter couples to a causal metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ (preserving exact <strong>local</strong> Lorentz invariance and a locally invariant $c$ in freely falling frames), the global time field $\phi$ induces path-dependent synchronization non-integrability. The "preferred" CMB frame is not an ether, but the natural cosmological rest frame of the scalar time field $\phi$, consistent with the background evolution of the universe. Thus, the signal represents a breakdown of <strong>global simultaneity</strong>, not local covariance.</p>
</div>

<p>This finding has profound implications: the anisotropy modulation couples to the CMB frame, indicating the underlying phenomenon operates at cosmic scales. The TEP signal appears to reflect Earth's absolute motion through space at 370 km/s, as defined by the cosmic microwave background. The convergence of RINEX's 3-year raw SPP analysis (19.3° CMB separation) with CODE's 25-year precise PPP analysis (18.2° CMB separation) provides strong independent validation from completely different data and methodology.</p>

<h3>6.2.4 Synthesis: A Unified Physical Picture</h3>

<p>Taken together, the findings present a coherent physical narrative. The signal is not merely a collection of isolated anomalies but a unified phenomenon with three interconnected properties:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Metric Fluctuation:</strong> The identical coupling of spatial (position jitter) and temporal (clock bias) variance confirms the signal affects the spacetime metric itself, not just clocks or orbits independently.</li>
    <li><strong>Cosmic Reference:</strong> The alignment with the CMB frame (and rejection of the Solar Apex) anchors this metric fluctuation to the universe's absolute rest frame, suggesting a cosmological origin rather than a local galactic one.</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity Dependence:</strong> The modulation with Earth's orbital velocity (r = −0.548 to −0.752) confirms the coupling is kinematic—dependent on Earth's motion through this cosmic frame.</li>
</ol>
<p>This triplet—Spacetime Symmetry, CMB Alignment, and Velocity Dependence— constitutes the core empirical signature of the Temporal Equivalence Principle.</p>

<h3>6.2.5 Robustness to Noise</h3>

<p>A notable feature is that TEP signatures remain detectable despite the substantially higher noise floor of SPP solutions. Single-frequency SPP yields meter-level position noise and nanosecond-level clock noise—orders of magnitude worse than PPP—yet the spatial coherence function maintains R² &gt; 0.97 across multiple metrics. This robustness indicates that the underlying effect is not a fragile feature visible only in ultra-clean precise products, but a relatively strong modulation imprinted directly on the raw observables.</p>

<h3>6.2.6 Context: Atomic Clock Networks for Fundamental Physics</h3>

<p>This work contributes to a growing body of research using globally-distributed atomic clock networks for fundamental physics. Wcisło et al. (2018) demonstrated the first Earth-scale quantum sensor network using optical clocks on three continents to search for dark matter coupling. Lisdat et al. (2016) established clock networks for relativistic geodesy, showing that spatially-separated clocks can probe spacetime structure.</p>

<p>This analysis extends this paradigm by demonstrating that the existing global GNSS network—with ~440 stations operating continuously for decades—constitutes a large-scale, unintentional quantum sensor network. The detected distance-structured correlations with characteristic lengths of 1,000–4,000 km represent a previously uncharacterized phenomenon that warrants further investigation within the frameworks of screened scalar field theory (Burrage & Sakstein, 2018) and beyond-Standard-Model physics.</p>

<h3>6.2.7 Reinterpreting Common Mode Error</h3>

<p>Over the past decade, a substantial literature in the <em>Journal of Geodesy</em> and related journals has documented that GNSS "noise" is neither white nor independent, but instead forms a spatially correlated, multi-scale random field on the Earth’s surface. Recent work by Gobron et al. (2024), Niu et al. (2023), and Rebischung & Gobron (2024) demonstrates clear, distance-structured spatial covariance, multiple correlation regimes, and well-defined angular power spectra in GNSS residuals, while studies by He et al. (2021), Santamaría-Gómez & Ray (2021), and Ray et al. (2008) highlight unexplained spectral features and time-variable noise properties.</p>

<p>In the present series these empirical findings are taken one step further: it is shown that, after exhaustive correction for known geophysical and processing contributions, the remaining correlated component exhibits a stable, reproducible pattern across independent datasets (CODE PPP vs raw RINEX SPP), including a characteristic anisotropy between east–west and north–south directions. It is argued that this residual, geometry-dependent field is more naturally interpreted as a manifestation of a dynamical temporal-gravitational field (the Temporal Equivalence Principle) than as yet another layer of ad-hoc "noise".</p>

<h2>6.3 Methodological Implications</h2>

<h3>6.3.1 Democratizing TEP Research</h3>

<p>The methodology established in this paper enables TEP detection using only:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Publicly available RINEX data from CDDIS</li>
    <li>Open-source RTKLIB software</li>
    <li>Standard Python scientific libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>This lowers the barrier for independent verification. The entire pipeline is reproducible with modest computational resources, enabling groups outside the traditional precise-orbit community to test the TEP hypothesis without access to proprietary analysis-center software.</p>

<h3>6.3.2 Time Alignment via Pandas DatetimeIndex</h3>

<p>Time alignment uses Pandas DataFrame indexing with DatetimeIndex, identical to the CODE longspan methodology in Papers 1 and 2. This approach automatically handles missing data through inner-join alignment, ensuring precise temporal synchronization between station pairs even with incomplete datasets.</p>

<h2>6.4 Limitations and Future Work</h2>

<h3>6.4.1 Current Limitations</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Single-frequency processing:</strong> Baseline SPP uses only L1 pseudoranges, limiting ionospheric correction accuracy</li>
    <li><strong>Broadcast ephemeris accuracy:</strong> ~1 m position, ~5 ns clock (vs. cm-level for precise products)</li>
    <li><strong>Southern Hemisphere coverage:</strong> Only 8.6M pairs vs 51M Northern, limiting statistical power</li>
    <li><strong>Kp as coarse diagnostic:</strong> While the Kp stratification test (Section 3.6) demonstrates geomagnetic independence with Δλ &lt; 4%, Kp summarizes global conditions and does not capture all aspects of local ionospheric structure. Regional or TEC-based indices could provide finer discrimination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.4.2 Completed Analyses</h3>

<div>
    <h4>Orbital Velocity Coupling — Confirmed</h4>
    <p>The orbital velocity correlation (as in Paper 2) has been successfully tested and confirmed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Best result:</strong> r = −0.752, 5.3σ (Multi-GNSS pos_jitter/phase); MSC confirms at r = −0.659, 4.4σ</li>
        <li><strong>Baseline GPS:</strong> r = −0.548, 3.5σ (clock_bias/msc)</li>
        <li><strong>Ionospheric independence:</strong> Signal survives ionofree (r = −0.341, 2.0σ)</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal breathing:</strong> Equinox/Solstice ratio 1.33–1.58 across all modes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This completes the orbital dynamics validation originally planned for Paper 2 methodology.</p>

<p>All fourteen key predictions are consistently supported. The detection of exponential decay, directional anisotropy, and orbital velocity coupling in raw data—all matching CODE's 25-year PPP findings—provides strong validation of the TEP hypothesis within the GNSS domain. The independent corroboration of Southern Hemisphere enhancement across Papers 2 and 3 (different datasets, different methodologies) and the discovery of spacetime symmetry (pos_jitter ≈ clock_bias) provide additional evidence for the physical reality of the signal.</p>
