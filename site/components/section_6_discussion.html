<h2>6. Discussion</h2>

<h3>6.1 Significance of Raw Data Detection</h3>

<p>The detection of directionally structured correlations in raw RINEX observations, processed with Single Point Positioning and broadcast ephemerides, provides a direct test of whether the reported structures are present in the raw observables. Previous analyses relied on precise orbit and clock products from analysis centers (CODE, ESA, IGS), leaving open the possibility that network adjustment or clock-constraint algorithms might introduce correlated residuals. By recovering an exponential decay form and directional anisotropy using only raw observations and broadcast ephemerides, this analysis indicates that the observed patterns are not solely attributable to precise-product generation.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The Processing Artifact Hypothesis — Addressed</h3>
    <p>Critics of Papers 1 and 2 could reasonably argue that the sophisticated algorithms used by CODE, ESA, and IGS to generate precise products might inadvertently create correlated residuals. These algorithms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network adjustment with inter-station constraints</li>
        <li>Reference frame alignment procedures</li>
        <li>Common ionospheric and tropospheric models</li>
        <li>Clock constraint strategies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The processing artifact hypothesis is further challenged by the observation of directional anisotropy. The short-distance E-W/N-S ratios of 1.033 (MSC) and 1.224 (Phase Alignment) are highly significant (nominal p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup> under the standard null) and consistent with CODE's directional signature. A critical audit reveals this signal is not a distance artifact: E-W pairs are actually 13 km longer than N-S pairs (a bias <em>against</em> the signal), and robust distance-matching strengthens the ratio (1.033 → 1.041).</p>
    
    <div class="callout callout-info">
        <h5>Why Tropospheric Weather Is Not the Cause</h5>
        <p>A potential objection is that the short-distance E-W anisotropy simply reflects prevailing weather patterns (Westerlies). This possibility is disfavored by four considerations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Orbital Coupling: Weather does not modulate with Earth's orbital velocity (r = −0.509 to −0.763, 3.2–5.4σ).</li>
            <li>Ionofree Persistence: The inferred correlation length increases (λ = 6060 km) when ionospheric delay is removed. Tropospheric delay is non-dispersive and would not be selectively enhanced by the ionofree combination.</li>
            <li>CMB Alignment: Weather patterns do not align with the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole (20.0° separation, p &lt; 10<sup>−35</sup>) (Burde, 2016; Consoli & Pluchino, 2021).</li>
            <li>Ionospheric Gradient Scale: Lee & Lee (2019) show ionospheric spatial gradients are &lt;0.01 TECU/km under quiet conditions—far smaller than the effect observed here, which persists across all geomagnetic conditions.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>6.2 Physical Implications</h3>

<h4>6.2.1 Space-Time Coupling Supported</h4>

<p>The comparable correlation lengths for position jitter (spatial proxy, λ = 883 km) and clock bias (temporal proxy, λ = 727 km) are consistent with the expectation that spatial and temporal fluctuations are coupled. The similar scales (within 21%) suggest that a common mechanism influences both space and time measurements.</p>

<p>Additional evidence from orbital coupling analysis: Position jitter and clock bias show similar orbital velocity coupling (baseline: r = −0.509 vs −0.486, difference of 5%; multi_gnss: r = −0.610 vs −0.581, difference of 5%). This approximate spacetime symmetry is consistent with a common coupling affecting spatial and temporal observables. Multi-GNSS pos_jitter/phase yields the strongest correlation among the tested modes (r = −0.763, 5.4σ).</p>

<h4>6.2.2 Directional Anisotropy as Physical Signature</h4>

<p>The detected E-W/N-S anisotropy ratio of 1.033–1.224 (raw short-distance) and 1.80–1.86 (geometry-corrected) provides a distinct directional signature. This pattern:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Matches CODE's 25-year finding (ratio 2.16)</li>
    <li>Is difficult to attribute to isotropic noise sources</li>
    <li>Persists across all processing modes and geomagnetic conditions</li>
    <li>Appears in both hemispheres with the same polarity in the ALL_STATIONS stratification, while higher-quality subsets motivate additional hemisphere-controlled falsification tests to assess subset-dependent behavior</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.2.2a The Two-Mechanism Model: Geometry vs Ionosphere</h4>

<p>First-principles GPS geometry simulation (Step 2.9) reveals two competing mechanisms that explain the distance-dependent anisotropy pattern and resolve the apparent sign reversal at long distances:</p>

<div style="background: #f5f7f6; border-left: 4px solid #5a7d7c; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
    <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #3d5a5a;">Mechanism 1: Geometric Suppression (PDOP Anisotropy)</h5>
    <p>GPS orbital inclination (55°) creates anisotropic satellite visibility. Pure geometry simulation with PDOP-weighted synthetic clocks yields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>E-W mean λ: 265 km</li>
        <li>N-S mean λ: 3,994 km</li>
        <li>E-W/N-S Ratio: 0.066 (15× suppression factor)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key Point: Derived from GPS constellation geometry <em>without any reference to CODE or empirical TEP results</em>. This breaks the circularity argument.</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #f8f6f3; border-left: 4px solid #8a8580; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
    <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #5a5a5a;">Mechanism 2: Ionospheric Local-Time Decorrelation</h5>
    <p>E-W station pairs span different time zones, experiencing different ionospheric phases. Simulation with diurnal TEC model (TEC = TEC₀ × [1 + 0.5 × cos(2π × (LST − 14)/24)]) yields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>E-W mean λ: 1,959 km</li>
        <li>N-S mean λ: 100 km</li>
        <li>E-W/N-S Ratio: 19.6 (20× enhancement, <em>opposite direction</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key Point: Ionospheric decorrelation creates E-W enhancement, opposite to geometric suppression.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h5>Distance-Dependent Behavior</h5>
    <p>These mechanisms operate at different distance scales, explaining the observed pattern:</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Distance Range</th>
            <th>Dominant Mechanism</th>

        <tr style="background-color: #f5f7fa;">
            <td>&lt;500 km</td>
            <td>Geometry weak, ionosphere minimal</td>
            <td>1.20–1.23</td>
            <td>Primary Evidence</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>500–1000 km</td>
            <td>Both mechanisms active</td>
            <td>~1.0 (crossover)</td>
            <td>Transition zone</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;1000 km</td>
            <td>Ionosphere dominates</td>
            <td>&lt;1.0 (inverted)</td>
            <td>Sign reversal</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Resolution: The short-distance E-W/N-S ratio (1.20–1.23) serves as the primary directional evidence, requiring no geometric correction. At long distances (&gt;1000 km), both mechanisms are active with ionosphere dominating, creating the observed sign reversal. After correcting for the 15× geometric suppression factor (derived from first principles), the long-distance ratio recovers to 1.46, within 32% of CODE's 25-year benchmark (2.16). This provides secondary validation while maintaining independence of the primary evidence.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout-info" style="margin-top: 20px;">
    <h5>Peer Review Response: Circularity Eliminated</h5>
    <p>The primary directional evidence (short-distance E-W/N-S = 1.20–1.23) is independent of CODE and requires no correction. The geometric suppression factor (15×) is derived from first principles using only GPS orbital parameters. The long-distance correction serves as secondary validation, not primary evidence. Circularity is eliminated.</p>
</div>

<h4>6.2.3 CMB Frame Alignment: A Cosmic Reference</h4>

<p>The comprehensive 72-combination CMB frame analysis suggests that the annual modulation of EW/NS anisotropy is consistent with a direction close to the Cosmic Microwave Background dipole. This analysis evaluates the full combination set to assess robustness across processing choices.</p>

<div>
    <h5>Physical Implications of CMB Alignment</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Best-fit RA = 188°, Dec = −5°, only 20.0° from CMB dipole (168°, −7°)—matching CODE's 25-year benchmark of 18.2°</li>
        <li>78% RA clustering: Of 54 clean (non-Ionofree) combinations, 42 find RA within 10° of CMB (p &lt; 10<sup>−35</sup> under a simplified binomial model)</li>
        <li>Signal Booster: Aggressive quality filtering (Dynamic-50: daily files with clock std &lt; 50 ns) boosts correlation to r = 0.660 (vs. typical r ≈ 0.51), confirming the signal is physical and high-fidelity.</li>
        <li>Solar Apex disfavored at 86.5° separation (4.3× farther than CMB, 32× worse variance explained)</li>
        <li>Zero-variance filter independence: All three station filters converge to same RA (CV = 0.3%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The CMB provides a well-defined cosmological reference frame in which the cosmic microwave background is (to high precision) isotropic. Under standard interpretation, the observed CMB dipole arises from Earth's motion relative to this frame (Burde, 2016; Consoli &amp; Pluchino, 2021). If the anisotropy modulation depends on a preferred velocity direction, the CMB dipole is therefore a physically motivated direction to test. The large separation from the Solar Apex direction suggests that any preferred direction inferred from the data is not aligned with the Sun's local galactic motion.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h5>Theoretical Resolution: Bi-Metric Geometry & Local Invariance</h5>
    <p>The apparent conflict with standard Lorentz invariance can be addressed within the Bi-Metric Geometry framework detailed in the companion theory paper (<em>Smawfield, 2025, TEP theory preprint</em>). The theory postulates that while matter couples to a causal metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ (preserving exact local Lorentz invariance and a locally invariant $c$ in freely falling frames), the global time field $\phi$ induces path-dependent synchronization non-integrability. The "preferred" CMB frame is not an ether, but the natural cosmological rest frame of the scalar time field $\phi$, consistent with the background evolution of the universe. Thus, the signal represents a breakdown of global simultaneity, not local covariance.</p>
</div>

<p>These results suggest that the anisotropy modulation is associated with a direction close to the CMB dipole. Interpreted in this way, the inferred direction corresponds to Earth's motion relative to the CMB frame (~370 km/s). The close agreement between the RINEX 3-year raw SPP analysis (20.0° CMB separation) and the CODE 25-year PPP analysis (18.2° CMB separation) provides a cross-check across independent data sources and processing methodologies.</p>

<h3>6.2.4 Synthesis: A Unified Physical Picture</h3>

<p>Taken together, the findings present a coherent physical narrative. The signal is not merely a collection of isolated anomalies but a unified phenomenon with three interconnected properties:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Not random noise: nominal p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup> across 172 million pairs under the standard null; orbital coupling at 5.4σ; shuffle test shows strong evidence ratio (mean ~30×, min 1.9×) with 90% passing strict R² &lt; 0.3 threshold</li>
    <li>Cosmic Reference: The alignment with the CMB frame (and rejection of the Solar Apex) links the inferred preferred direction to a cosmologically defined reference frame, suggesting a cosmological rather than local galactic association.</li>
    <li>Velocity Dependence: The modulation with Earth's orbital velocity (r = −0.509 to −0.763) is consistent with a kinematic dependence on Earth's motion relative to that reference direction.</li>
</ol>
<p>This triplet—Spacetime Symmetry, CMB Alignment, and Velocity Dependence—summarizes the central empirical signature reported here, consistent with the Temporal Equivalence Principle.</p>

<h3>6.2.5 Robustness to Noise</h3>

<p>A notable feature is that TEP-related signatures remain detectable despite the substantially higher noise floor of SPP solutions. Single-frequency SPP yields meter-level position noise and nanosecond-level clock noise—orders of magnitude worse than PPP—yet the spatial coherence function maintains R² &gt; 0.97 across multiple metrics. This suggests that the relevant correlation structure is not confined to ultra-clean precise products and is present in the raw observables at a level detectable with the current methodology.</p>

<h3>6.2.6 Context: Atomic Clock Networks for Fundamental Physics</h3>

<p>This work contributes to a growing body of research using globally-distributed atomic clock networks for fundamental physics. Wcisło et al. (2018) demonstrated the first Earth-scale quantum sensor network using optical clocks on three continents to search for dark matter coupling. Lisdat et al. (2016) established clock networks for relativistic geodesy, showing that spatially-separated clocks can probe spacetime structure.</p>

<p>This analysis extends this paradigm by showing that the existing global GNSS network—with 539 stations operating continuously for decades—can be treated as a large-scale distributed clock network. The detected distance-structured correlations with characteristic lengths of 1,000–4,000 km motivate further investigation within the frameworks of screened scalar field theory (Burrage &amp; Sakstein, 2018) and beyond-Standard-Model physics.</p>

<h3>6.2.7 Reinterpreting Common Mode Error</h3>

<p>Over the past decade, a substantial literature in the <em>Journal of Geodesy</em> and related journals has documented that GNSS "noise" is neither white nor independent, but instead forms a spatially correlated, multi-scale random field on the Earth’s surface. Recent work by Gobron et al. (2024), Niu et al. (2023), and Rebischung & Gobron (2024) demonstrates clear, distance-structured spatial covariance, multiple correlation regimes, and well-defined angular power spectra in GNSS residuals, while studies by He et al. (2021), Santamaría-Gómez & Ray (2021), and Ray et al. (2008) highlight unexplained spectral features and time-variable noise properties.</p>

<p>In the present series these empirical findings are taken one step further: it is shown that, after correction for known geophysical and processing contributions, the remaining correlated component exhibits a stable, reproducible pattern across independent datasets (CODE PPP vs raw RINEX SPP), including a characteristic anisotropy between east–west and north–south directions. One possible interpretation is that this residual, geometry-dependent field reflects a dynamical temporal-gravitational component (the Temporal Equivalence Principle), rather than being treated solely as an additional empirical noise component.</p>

<h3>6.3 Methodological Implications</h3>

<h4>6.3.1 Enabling Independent Verification</h4>

<p>The methodology established in this paper enables testing of the TEP hypothesis using only:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Publicly available RINEX data from CDDIS</li>
    <li>Open-source RTKLIB software</li>
    <li>Standard Python scientific libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>This lowers the barrier for independent verification. The entire pipeline is reproducible with modest computational resources, enabling groups outside the traditional precise-orbit community to test the TEP hypothesis without access to proprietary analysis-center software.</p>

<h4>6.3.2 Time Alignment via Pandas DatetimeIndex</h4>

<p>Time alignment uses Pandas DataFrame indexing with DatetimeIndex, identical to the CODE longspan methodology in Papers 1 and 2. This approach automatically handles missing data through inner-join alignment, ensuring precise temporal synchronization between station pairs even with incomplete datasets.</p>

<h3>6.4 Limitations and Future Work</h3>

<h4>6.4.1 Current Limitations</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Single-frequency processing: Baseline SPP uses only L1 pseudoranges, limiting ionospheric correction accuracy</li>
    <li>Broadcast ephemeris accuracy: ~1 m position, ~5 ns clock (vs. cm-level for precise products)</li>
    <li>Southern Hemisphere coverage: Only 8.6M pairs vs 51M Northern, limiting statistical power</li>
    <li>Kp as coarse diagnostic: While the Kp stratification test (Section 3.6) demonstrates geomagnetic independence at the primary threshold (Kp &lt; 3 vs. Kp ≥ 3; median Δλ ≈ −1%, with 60/72 tests within ±5%), Kp summarizes global conditions and does not capture all aspects of local ionospheric structure. Stricter storm definitions (Kp ≥ 4/5) were examined as sensitivity checks but involve far fewer storm days. Regional or TEC-based indices could provide finer discrimination.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.4.2 Completed Analyses</h4>

<div>
    <h5>Orbital Velocity Coupling — Detected</h5>
    <p>The orbital velocity correlation (as in Paper 2) has been tested and is detected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Best result: r = −0.763, 5.4σ (Multi-GNSS pos_jitter/phase); MSC yields r = −0.610, 4.0σ</li>
        <li>Baseline GPS: r = −0.509, 3.2σ</li>
        <li>Ionospheric independence: Signal persists under ionofree (best: r = −0.416, 2.5σ)</li>
        <li>Seasonal breathing: Equinox/Solstice ratio 1.33–1.58 across all modes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This completes the orbital dynamics validation originally planned for Paper 2 methodology.</p>

<p>Across the fourteen comparisons summarized above, the observations are broadly consistent with the listed expectations. The detection of exponential decay, directional anisotropy, and orbital velocity coupling in raw data—together with their qualitative agreement with CODE's 25-year PPP findings—provides an internal cross-check within the GNSS domain. The agreement on Southern Hemisphere enhancement across Papers 2 and 3 (different datasets, different methodologies) and the observed spacetime symmetry (pos_jitter ≈ clock_bias) further support the interpretation of a reproducible, non-random correlation structure.</p>
