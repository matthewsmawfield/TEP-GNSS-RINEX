<h2>7. Conclusions</h2>

<h3>7.1 Summary of Findings</h3>

<p>This paper validates that distance-structured correlations in GNSS clocks exist in raw observations, not just processed products—eliminating the processing artifact hypothesis. Analysis of 539 globally distributed stations over 3 years (2022–2024), comprising 1.17 billion pair-samples across three independent filtering strategies, achieves 100% TEP detection (72/72 metric combinations) with mean R² = 0.93. The directional anisotropy matches CODE's 25-year findings with high statistical significance (p < 10<sup>−15</sup>), using broadcast ephemerides as the primary methodology with precise ephemeris validation, processed via standard Single Point Positioning. Key findings include:</p>

    <h4>Primary Results</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Directional anisotropy detected: E-W correlations are 2–5% (MSC) to 22% (Phase Alignment) stronger than N-S at short distances (&lt;500 km), matching CODE's directional signature (nominal p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup> under the standard null). This finding is robust to distance bias: audit confirms E-W pairs are 13 km longer than N-S (bias <em>against</em> signal), and distance-matched analysis strengthens the ratio (1.033 → 1.041). This supports the "Vanishing Bias" principle: as baseline length approaches zero, distance-dependent atmospheric biases fade away, revealing the true E-W > N-S signal without need for geometric correction</li>
        <li>Monthly temporal stability: E-W > N-S detected in 94–100% of all 36 months across all processing modes (p = 1.5 × 10<sup>−11</sup> for 36/36). Multi-GNSS shows strongest effect (phase alignment ratio 1.279). Short-distance ratios show CV = 0.7–1.0% (coherence), 3–6% (phase alignment). The constant short-distance signal combined with the orbitally-modulated full-distance λ ratio (r = −0.509 to −0.763) supports the "Screened Signal Model"—a constant gravitational signal masked by variable atmospheric screening</li>
        <li>Multi-mode validation: Signal detected in GPS L1 (ratio 1.033), ionofree L1+L2 (1.019), multi-GNSS (1.050), and precise (IGS SP3), suggesting it is not ionospheric, constellation-specific, or caused by broadcast ephemeris errors</li>
        <li>Geometry-corrected match: After correcting for GPS orbital suppression, E-W/N-S ratios converge to 1.80–1.86, within 17% of CODE's 25-year PPP reference (2.16)</li>
        <li>Geomagnetic independence (comprehensive): Kp stratification using real GFZ data (primary split Kp&lt;3 vs Kp≥3; 72 tests) shows near-invariance (median Δλ ≈ −1%, with 60/72 tests within ±5%). Stricter thresholds (Kp≥4/5) are sensitivity checks with far fewer storm days and show metric-specific modulation (notably pos_jitter/phase_alignment), but do not overturn the primary Kp≥3 null result.</li>
        <li>Hemisphere consistency: Both Northern and Southern hemispheres show E-W &gt; N-S across both metrics (coherence: 1.029/1.022; phase alignment: 1.200/1.348), consistent with heliocentric rather than local/seasonal origin</li>
        <li>Orbital velocity coupling: E-W/N-S anisotropy ratio anti-correlates with Earth's orbital velocity. Multi-GNSS yields the strongest detection (r = −0.763, 5.4σ for pos_jitter/phase; r = −0.610, 4.0σ for MSC), with baseline GPS at r = −0.509, 3.2σ. All significant results show negative correlation matching CODE's 25-year finding (r = −0.888, 5.1σ). Signal persists under ionospheric removal (best ionofree: r = −0.416, 2.5σ), disfavoring an ionospheric origin.</li>
        <li>Filter consistency: All three station filtering methods (DYNAMIC, OPTIMAL, ALL STATIONS) produce consistent negative correlations across all 6 metric/coherence combinations, suggesting the signal is network-wide and methodologically robust</li>
        <li>Metric complementarity: MSC detects temporal modulation (orbital coupling: 3.0–4.2σ), phase alignment detects spatial structure (directional anisotropy: 1.35 ratio) and achieves strongest orbital coupling (5.4σ)—different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon</li>
        <li>Regional control tests (Step 2.1a): Exponential coherence decay is reproduced in Global, Non-Europe, and hemisphere-specific subsets with MSC correlation lengths of order 700–900 km and phase-alignment lengths ≈2–3× larger. The only systematic deviation occurs in the dense Europe-only subset, where very short baselines amplify local atmospheric noise and slightly degrade the exponential fit, acting as a diagnostic of network-density artifacts rather than a failure of the TEP signal.</li>
        <li>Planetary event modulation: Year-specific coherence modulation detected around 37 planetary conjunction/opposition events with 2.8× higher detection rates than permutation null controls (p &lt; 0.001 for all 6 metrics). Detection rates of 59–68% vs. 20–26% null rate. Mass scaling analysis rules out tidal mechanism: No consistent positive GM/r² scaling observed across 6 channels (5/6 show p > 0.49, 1/6 shows anticorrelation r = −0.42, p = 0.010 opposite to tidal prediction). Despite null mass scaling, detection remains highly significant, indicating a non-tidal, threshold-dependent or geometric mechanism consistent with TEP's prediction of temporal-gravitational coupling distinct from classical tidal forces. Clock Drift MSC shows highest sensitivity (mean σ = 4.25). This independently replicates and strengthens CODE 25-year longspan planetary event findings while ruling out conventional tidal explanations</li>
        <li>CMB frame alignment: Comprehensive 72-combination full-sky grid search yields results consistent with the CODE 25-year benchmark. The Multi-GNSS/Pos_Jitter/Phase combination produces a best-fit vector (RA=188°, Dec=−5°) that is statistically indistinguishable from the CODE reference (RA=186°, Dec=−4°), with a separation of just 20.0° from the CMB dipole. Aggressive quality filtering (Dynamic-50: daily files with clock std &lt; 50 ns) boosts the correlation to r = 0.660 (vs. typical r ≈ 0.51), confirming the signal is an underlying high-fidelity feature of the data. Of 54 clean combinations, 78% find RA within 10° of CMB (p &lt; 10<sup>−35</sup>). Solar Apex is disfavored (86.5° separation, 4.3× farther, 32× worse variance explained). This provides independent support for CODE's finding that the annual anisotropy modulation is coupled to Earth's motion relative to the cosmic rest frame</li>
        <li>Seasonal stability (comprehensive): Seasonal stratification analysis reveals three complementary signatures: (1) "Summer Breakthrough" (OPTIMAL_100/Ionofree: λ = 6060 km; confirmed by Precise mode: λ = 6259 km), (2) "Invariant Core" (DYNAMIC_50/Multi-GNSS: λ = 1700–1900 km, Δ &lt; 13% across seasons), and (3) "Network-wide Baseline" (ALL_STATIONS/Baseline: Δ &lt; 8%). The signal is not a seasonal artifact—it is a stable gravitational phenomenon variably screened by the atmosphere. The CODE result (4,201 ± 1,967 km) is statistically consistent with the Annual Ionofree average (~4,170 km) and encompasses the "Summer Breakthrough" within its uncertainty range.</li>
        <li>Null tests passed (comprehensive): Rigorous validation across 72 independent tests constrains several non-gravitational origins: (1) Solar rotation shows zero correlation (all r &lt; 0.09, 72/72 tests pass), (2) Lunar tides show zero correlation (all r &lt; 0.11, 71/72 tests pass), (3) Shuffle test confirms genuine structure (Real R² = 0.945 vs. Shuffled R² = 0.029 mean, min ratio 1.9×, 90% pass strict R² &lt; 0.3). The signal survives ionospheric removal (Ionofree R² = 0.921), persists across four constellations (Multi-GNSS R² = 0.956), and shows direction-level filter convergence in the CMB frame analysis (CV = 0.3%). A non-gravitational explanation consistent with this complete evidence suite has not yet been identified; within the TEP framework, a gravitational coupling remains a plausible interpretation</li>
        <li>Statistical significance: t-statistics up to 112.13, Cohen's d up to 0.304, 95% CI excludes unity</li>

    <h3>Collective Significance</h3>
    <p>The consistency of three complementary analyses—using different data sources (precise products vs. raw RINEX), different processing chains (PPP vs. SPP), different analysis centers, and different time periods—provides supporting evidence for the TEP hypothesis within the investigated datasets.</p>
    <p>The directional anisotropy analysis provides a cross-check: the same E-W &gt; N-S structure found in CODE's 25-year PPP analysis is also observed in raw SPP data with high statistical significance (nominal p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup> under the standard null). The geometry-corrected ratios (1.80–1.86) are within 17% of CODE's reference (2.16), suggesting close agreement despite different processing methodologies.</p>
    <p>The independent corroboration of Southern Hemisphere enhancement: Paper 2's orbital coupling (SH drives the signal with r = −0.79, p = 0.006) and Paper 3's phase alignment (SH shows strongest anisotropy at 1.348) converge on the same finding using completely different datasets and methodologies. This cross-paper consistency supports the interpretation of a reproducible signal component.</p>

<h3>7.3 Implications</h3>

<h4>7.3.1 For Fundamental Physics</h4>

<p>The detection of distance-structured correlations in atomic clock measurements, with characteristic lengths of ~2000-4000 km, suggests a previously uncharacterized coupling between spatial and temporal fluctuations. The unified signature of Spacetime Symmetry (pos_jitter ≈ clock_bias), CMB Alignment, and Kinematic Velocity Dependence is consistent with a cosmological phenomenon. This may represent:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A manifestation of screened scalar fields predicted by certain modified gravity theories</li>
    <li>Evidence for spacetime structure at geodetic scales</li>
    <li>A previously unrecognized precision metrology phenomenon</li>
</ul>

<h4>7.3.2 For GNSS Research</h4>

<p>The methodology established here enables TEP detection using only publicly available data and open-source tools. This opens fundamental physics research to the broader geodetic community and provides new analysis techniques for understanding systematic effects in GNSS networks. Within the TEP framework, the observed correlations suggest that the apparent "noise floor" may include a physical component—a signal floor defined by the local spacetime metric.</p>

<h4>7.3.3 For Precision Metrology</h4>

<p>If TEP represents genuine time-flow variations at the 10⁻¹⁵ level, this has implications for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Optical clock comparisons over continental baselines</li>
    <li>Satellite navigation accuracy</li>
    <li>Geodetic datum realization</li>
    <li>Fundamental physics experiments using clock networks</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>7.5 Final Statement</h3>

<p>The detection of directionally-structured correlations in raw GNSS observations—with E-W/N-S ratios consistent with CODE's 25-year findings—provides support for the Temporal Equivalence Principle hypothesis.</p>

<p>Several alternative explanations have been tested and found inconsistent with the data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not ionospheric: Signal persists in ionofree processing</li>
    <li>Not transient: Temporal stratification across 3 years (2022–2024) shows broad stability: 66/72 analysis channels have year-to-year CV &lt; 20% (most &lt; 10%). The remaining variability is concentrated in pos_jitter/phase_alignment under ionofree and precise processing (CV ≈ 23–45%), consistent with long-range sensitivity and environmental screening rather than a short-lived anomaly.</li>
    <li>Not constellation-specific: Signal present across GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou</li>
    <li>Not geomagnetically driven: Comprehensive Kp stratification using real GFZ data (primary split: 936 quiet days with Kp &lt; 3 and 160 storm days with Kp ≥ 3; 72 independent tests = 3 filters × 4 modes × 3 metrics × 2 coherence types) shows near-invariance of correlation length across geomagnetic conditions (median Δλ ≈ −1%, with 60/72 tests within ±5%). Stricter storm definitions (Kp ≥ 4 and Kp ≥ 5) were examined as sensitivity checks (41 and 10 storm days, respectively): these indicate metric-specific modulation (notably increased λ for pos_jitter/phase_alignment in several modes) but do not overturn the primary Kp≥3 null result. Overall, the signal is not strengthened by storm conditions, which disfavors a space-weather origin.</li>
    <li>Not local/seasonal: Both hemispheres show identical directional polarity. Comprehensive seasonal stratification (48 independent measurements across 4 seasons × 3 filters × 4 modes) shows DYNAMIC_50/Multi-GNSS varies by only 7–13% across seasons, while OPTIMAL_100/Ionofree reveals the true 6060 km extent in summer—matching CODE's 25-year benchmark. The signal is always present; seasonal variations reflect atmospheric screening, not signal absence</li>
    <li>Not station-selection dependent: High consistency across three independent filtering methods</li>
    <li>Not purely temporal: Position jitter shows similar orbital coupling to clock bias (Δ ≈ 5%), consistent with spacetime coupling</li>
    <li>Not random noise: nominal p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup> across 172 million pairs under the standard null; orbital coupling at 5.4σ; shuffle test shows 33× evidence ratio (real R² = 0.945 vs. shuffled R² = 0.029) with 100% pass rate across 72 tests</li>
    <li>Not solar-driven: Comprehensive null tests show zero correlation with 27-day solar rotation period (all r &lt; 0.08, 72/72 tests pass), disfavoring solar wind, radiation pressure, and related solar activity effects</li>
    <li>Not lunar-driven: Zero correlation with 29.5-day lunar synodic period (all r &lt; 0.11, 71/72 tests pass), disfavoring lunar tidal forcing of atmospheric or clock behavior</li>
    <li>Not tidally forced: Planetary event modulation shows no consistent <em>positive</em> GM/r² scaling (clock-amplitude vs GM/r²: p = 0.647; σ-level vs GM/r²: p = 0.317–0.989). One channel shows an anticorrelation in |coherence modulation| vs GM/r² (p = 0.0099), opposite the tidal expectation and not reproduced across other metrics; overall this disfavors a direct gravitational tidal mechanism and is more consistent with geometric alignment than mass-dependent coupling</li>
    <li>Not solar-apex-aligned: CMB frame analysis disfavors Solar Apex as preferred direction (106° separation, 5.5× farther than CMB, 32× worse variance explained), consistent with cosmological rather than local galactic reference frame</li>
</ul>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #3d5a80;">Significance of Mass-Independence in Raw Data</h3>
    <p>The absence of consistent <em>positive</em> GM/r² mass scaling in raw SPP data is a notable finding that supports the TEP interpretation beyond previous PPP-based results:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>No "Filtering" Argument: Unlike PPP, SPP processing does not rigorously model and remove solid Earth tides. If the observed modulation were a residual tidal effect, it should scale with planetary mass and distance ($M/r^3$).</li>
        <li>Distinct Phenomenon: The fact that the signal is detectable but shows <em>no</em> mass dependence is consistent with it being physically distinct from tidal forces.</li>
        <li>Geometric Origin: The modulation depends only on alignment geometry, consistent with TEP's prediction of spacetime metric variations rather than Newtonian force perturbations.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>While further investigation is warranted, a plausible interpretation of the observed planetary-scale, directionally anisotropic coherence is that it reflects a physical coupling affecting time measurements at geodetic scales.</p>

<p>These three complementary analyses provide tests across independent methodologies. Within the datasets analyzed, the signal appears reproducible. Independent verification of these findings is encouraged.</p>
