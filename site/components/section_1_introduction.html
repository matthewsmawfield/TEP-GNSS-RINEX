<h1>1. Introduction: The TEP Research Program</h1>

<h2>1.1 The Theoretical Hypothesis</h2>

<p>The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) represents a proposed extension to the foundations of General Relativity, positing a fundamental coupling between spatial and temporal fluctuations in geodetic measurements. Unlike standard screened scalar field theories (Burrage & Sakstein, 2018) which predict strictly spatial gradients, TEP implies that local variations in the gravitational potential should manifest as synchronized fluctuations in the rate of proper time flow, observable in the phase coherence of spatially separated atomic clocks. Based on a <strong>Bi-Metric Geometry</strong> framework (Smawfield, 2025), this theory predicts a breakdown of <strong>global simultaneity</strong> while preserving exact <strong>local Lorentz invariance</strong>. This approach parallels recent advances in using global atomic clock networks for fundamental physics, including dark matter searches (Wcisło et al., 2018) and relativistic geodesy (Lisdat et al., 2016).</p>

<p>This hypothesis yields a specific, falsifiable prediction: Inter-station clock coherence should exhibit exponential decay with distance ($C(r) \propto e^{-r/\lambda}$), driven by a scalar field correlation length $\lambda$ on the order of 10³ km.</p>

<h2>1.2 The Empirical Foundation</h2>

<p>To date, this hypothesis has been tested through two comprehensive analyses:</p>

<div class="experimental-section">
    <h3>Paper 1: Multi-Center Validation</h3>
    <p>Analysis of precise orbit and clock products from three independent analysis centers (CODE, ESA, IGS) confirmed the existence of exponential decay signatures with λ ≈ 3,500–4,500 km. The consistency across centers (R² > 0.92) ruled out center-specific software artifacts.</p>

    <h3>Paper 2: 25-Year Temporal Stability</h3>
    <p>A longitudinal study of 25 years of CODE data (2000-2025) demonstrated that these signatures are not transient anomalies. They persist across solar cycles, hardware generations, and reference frame updates, exhibiting statistically significant coupling with orbital dynamics.</p>

<h2>1.3 The Processing Artifact Objection</h2>

<p>Despite these successes, a critical scientific objection remains valid:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Are these signatures artifacts of the sophisticated processing chains used to generate precise products, or do they exist in the raw observations themselves?"
</blockquote>

<p>Precise Point Positioning (PPP) products rely on sophisticated network adjustments, integer ambiguity resolution, and inter-station constraints—processes that could, in principle, introduce spurious long-range correlations. If the TEP signal were merely a byproduct of these mathematical filters, it would be a trivial software artifact. However, if the signal exists in the raw, noisy, uncorrected observations, it cannot be attributed to network adjustment algorithms. To rigorously validate TEP, it is necessary to descend the "ladder of precision" and detect the signal in its most fundamental form: raw pseudorange measurements processed with only broadcast ephemerides.</p>

<h2>1.4 Objectives of This Capstone Study</h2>

<p>This paper serves as the final study of the TEP-GNSS research program. Its primary objective is to perform an independent test of the TEP signal by:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Detecting TEP signatures in raw RINEX data</strong> using only Single Point Positioning (SPP) and broadcast ephemerides.</li>
    <li><strong>Validating directional anisotropy</strong> — confirming that E-W correlations exceed N-S as found in CODE's 25-year analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparing spatial vs. temporal correlation lengths</strong> to test the core Space-Time Coupling prediction.</li>
    <li><strong>Validating environmental independence</strong> — stratifying by geomagnetic activity and season to rule out ionospheric and atmospheric origins.</li>
    <li><strong>Synthesizing findings across all three papers</strong> to establish a unified evidence framework.</li>
</ol>
