    <p>This paper presents empirical evidence for Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) signatures in raw Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations, processed using standard Single Point Positioning (SPP) without external precise products. Analysis of 440 globally distributed stations over 3 years (2022–2024, comprising 172 million station pairs) reveals directionally-structured correlations consistent with CODE's 25-year PPP findings (p &lt; 10<sup>−300</sup>).</p>
    
    <p>The primary finding is directional anisotropy: East-West correlations are 2–5% (MSC) to 15–28% (Phase Alignment) stronger than North-South at short distances (&lt;500 km), with t-statistics up to 112 and Cohen's d up to 0.304. These short-distance ratios are raw, uncorrected values that directly match CODE's prediction (E-W &gt; N-S)—no geometric correction is required for the primary evidence. The "sign reversal" at long distances (E-W/N-S &lt; 1) arises from distance-dependent ionospheric and geometric biases; as baseline length approaches zero, these biases vanish, revealing the true E-W &gt; N-S signal. Secondary validation via geometric suppression analysis confirms this by correcting full-distance λ ratios to 1.79–1.86. The signal is detected across three independent processing modes—GPS L1 (ratio 1.033), dual-frequency ionofree (1.019), and multi-GNSS (1.050)—suggesting it is neither ionospheric nor constellation-specific.</p>
    
    <p>Critical validations include: (1) monthly stratification shows E-W > N-S in 94–100% of all 36 months across all processing modes (p = 1.5 × 10<sup>−11</sup> for 36/36), with short-distance ratio CV of 0.7–1% (coherence) and 3–6% (phase alignment)—indicating the underlying signal is constant every month, while full-distance λ ratios show orbital modulation (r = −0.515), supporting a constant gravitational signal masked by variable atmospheric screening; (2) signal persists under both geomagnetically quiet and storm conditions with invariant correlation structure (Δλ &lt; 4%); (3) both Northern (phase alignment ratio 1.200) and Southern (1.348) hemispheres show E-W &gt; N-S, consistent with a heliocentric rather than local/seasonal origin; (4) orbital velocity coupling confirmed at 3.3σ (r = −0.515), independently matching CODE's 25-year finding (r = −0.888), with all 18/18 metric combinations showing the same negative direction; (5) position jitter and clock bias show identical orbital coupling (Δ = 2%), consistent with spacetime—not just temporal—modulation; (6) zero-variance filter independence (σ² = 0 across three station selection methods) suggests the signal is network-wide, not an artifact of station selection; (7) planetary event modulation detected around 37 conjunction/opposition events with 2.1× higher coherence modulation than permutation null controls (p &lt; 0.05 for all 6 metrics), with no systematic mass dependence (GM/r²), ruling out direct tidal forcing and suggesting a geometric/kinematic alignment effect; (8) comprehensive 54-combination CMB frame analysis identifies preferred direction at RA = 157°, Dec = +9° (19.3° from CMB dipole), matching CODE's 25-year benchmark (18.2°) and strongly disfavoring Solar Apex (106° separation). Of 36 clean combinations, 78% find RA within 10° of CMB (p &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>), and three combinations converge on RA = 168° exactly (p = 1 in 46.7 million). The systematic elimination of ionospheric, constellation-specific, geomagnetic, processing, and station-selection artifacts, together with the CMB frame alignment, is consistent with the TEP hypothesis of gravitational coupling to Earth's absolute motion through the cosmic rest frame.</p>
    
    <p>This paper constitutes Paper 3 of the TEP-GNSS Research Series, providing critical raw-data validation of the directional anisotropy signature. Together with Papers 1 (multi-center) and 2 (25-year temporal stability), these three complementary analyses provide consistent evidence for planetary-scale, directionally-structured correlations in GNSS clock measurements. Independent replication by external research groups remains essential to rule out programme-specific systematics.</p>
