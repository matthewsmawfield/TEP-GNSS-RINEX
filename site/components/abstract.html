    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    
    <p>Prior TEP analyses relied on precise orbit and clock products from global analysis centers, leaving open the possibility that observed signatures were artifacts of sophisticated processing chains. This paper addresses that objection by detecting TEP signatures in raw GNSS observations processed using only Single Point Positioning (SPP) with broadcast ephemerides. Analysis of 440 globally distributed stations over 3 years (2022–2024, comprising 172 million station pairs) reveals directionally-structured correlations consistent with CODE's 25-year PPP findings (p &lt; 10<sup>−300</sup>).</p>
    
    <p>The primary finding is directional anisotropy: East-West correlations are 2–5% (MSC) to 15–28% (Phase Alignment) stronger than North-South at short distances (&lt;500 km), with t-statistics up to 112 and Cohen's d up to 0.304. These short-distance ratios are always &gt;1 and constant across all 36 months (CV &lt; 1%), consistent with CODE's prediction. At full distances, raw λ ratios (~0.95) are suppressed by distance-dependent biases; geometric correction recovers ratios of 1.79–1.86, matching CODE's benchmark (2.16) within 17%.</p>
    
    <p>Key validations include: (1) orbital velocity coupling detected at 3.5–5.3σ (best: r = −0.752), replicating CODE's 25-year finding (r = −0.888), with signal surviving ionospheric removal; (2) position jitter and clock bias show identical orbital coupling (Δ = 2–13%), consistent with spacetime—not just temporal—modulation; (3) CMB frame alignment at RA = 157° (19.3° from CMB dipole), matching CODE's benchmark, with Solar Apex statistically excluded (106° separation); (4) signal persists across geomagnetic conditions (Δλ &lt; 4%) and three processing modes (GPS L1, ionofree, multi-GNSS); (5) both hemispheres show E-W &gt; N-S (Northern: 1.200, Southern: 1.348); (6) planetary event modulation detected (2.1× above null, p &lt; 0.05) with no mass dependence—geometric rather than tidal.</p>
    
    <p>This paper constitutes Paper 3 of the TEP-GNSS Research Series. Together with Paper 1 (multi-center validation) and Paper 2 (25-year temporal stability), these three complementary analyses—using different data sources, processing chains, and time periods—provide consistent evidence for planetary-scale, directionally-structured correlations in GNSS clock measurements. The observed signature of spacetime symmetry, CMB alignment, and orbital velocity dependence is consistent with the Temporal Equivalence Principle hypothesis, which preserves local Lorentz invariance while predicting global path-dependent synchronization. Independent replication by external research groups remains essential.</p>
