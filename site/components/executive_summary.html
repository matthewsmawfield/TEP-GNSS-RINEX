            <h3 style="color: #220126; margin-top: 0;">Research Question</h3>
            <p>Prior TEP analyses (Papers 1 and 2) relied on precise orbit and clock products from global analysis centers. Since these products are derived using complex network adjustments and integer ambiguity resolution, a critical ambiguity remained:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px; color: #2D0140; margin: 20px 0;">"Are the observed signatures artifacts of the processing chain, or do they exist in the raw observations?"</p>
            <p>This study addresses this question. By analyzing raw RINEX pseudorange measurements processed via Single Point Positioning (SPP) primarily with broadcast ephemerides (supplemented by precise ephemeris validation), the results indicate that the same directional anisotropy, orbital velocity coupling, and CMB-frame alignment are present in the fundamental data. This is consistent with the interpretation that the observed structure is not solely a byproduct of precise product generation.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #220126; margin-top: 0;">Key Findings</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 10px 0;">
                <li><strong>Raw Data Validation (Key Achievement):</strong> TEP signatures detected in raw RINEX data using only broadcast ephemerides and Single Point Positioning—eliminating the processing artifact hypothesis. Analysis of 539 stations over 3 years (1.17 billion pair-samples) achieves 100% TEP detection with directional anisotropy matching CODE's 25-year findings (p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>).</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Detection across all Metrics:</strong> TEP-consistent signature detected in 72 out of 72 independent metrics (100%) across 3 station filters × 4 processing modes × 3 observables × 2 coherence types. Mean R² = 0.93, with all fits exceeding the 0.5 threshold.</li>
                <li><strong>Directional Anisotropy (Primary Evidence):</strong> E-W correlations are 2–5% (MSC) to 22% (Phase Alignment) stronger than N-S at short distances (&lt;500 km), matching CODE's directional signature with p &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>. These are raw, uncorrected values. A critical distance audit reveals E-W pairs are 13 km longer than N-S pairs (a bias <em>against</em> the signal); robust distance-matching strengthens the coherence ratio from 1.033 to 1.041. The "sign reversal" at long distances (E-W/N-S &lt; 1) arises from ionospheric and geometric biases that scale with distance; as baseline length approaches zero, these biases vanish, revealing the true E-W > N-S signal without correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Mode Validation:</strong> Signal detected in GPS-only (ratio 1.033), dual-frequency ionofree (1.019), and multi-GNSS (1.050)—suggesting it is not an ionospheric or single-constellation artifact.</li>
                <li><strong>Geometry-Corrected Match (Secondary Validation):</strong> Full-distance λ ratios, after correcting for GPS orbital suppression, converge to 1.80–1.86, within 17% of CODE's 25-year PPP reference (2.16). This explains why long-distance λ ratios appear inverted, but is not required for the primary short-distance finding.</li>
                <li><strong>Geomagnetic Independence:</strong> Primary Kp stratification (Kp&lt;3 vs Kp≥3) shows near-invariance (median Δλ ≈ −1%, 60/72 tests within ±5% across filters/modes/metrics). Stricter storm thresholds (Kp≥4/5) are treated as sensitivity checks due to small storm-day counts.</li>
                <li><strong>Hemisphere Consistency:</strong> Both Northern (phase alignment 1.200) and Southern (1.348) hemispheres show E-W &gt; N-S—consistent with a heliocentric rather than local/seasonal origin. The Southern Hemisphere's stronger signal corroborates CODE longspan findings.</li>
                <li><strong>Orbital Velocity Coupling:</strong> E-W/N-S anisotropy ratio anti-correlates with Earth's orbital velocity. Multi-GNSS yields the strongest detection: r = −0.763, 5.4σ (pos_jitter/phase), with MSC yielding r = −0.610, 4.0σ. Baseline GPS shows r = −0.509, 3.2σ. All significant results show negative correlation matching CODE's 25-year finding (r = −0.888, 5.1σ). Signal persists under ionospheric removal (best ionofree: r = −0.416, 2.5σ). A hemisphere-balanced DYNAMIC_50 control (110:110 downsample) strengthens to r = −0.864, 6.8σ (pos_jitter/phase), indicating the coupling is not removed by correcting hemisphere imbalance.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust Cross-Filter Consistency:</strong> All three station filtering methods (ALL_STATIONS, OPTIMAL_100, DYNAMIC_50) produce consistent correlation lengths with CV &lt; 15%: baseline λ = 632–766 km, ionofree λ = 813–1,084 km, multi-GNSS λ = 707–834 km, precise λ = 975–1,214 km. DYNAMIC_50 achieves highest R² (0.990 for baseline) by excluding noisy files. This pattern is less consistent with an artifact driven by station selection, geographic clustering, or data quality bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Ionofree Best Estimate:</strong> The ionofree mode (λ = 1,069 km, R² = 0.969) provides the most precise estimate of the underlying correlation length, with 47% longer λ and lower amplitude than baseline—consistent with ionospheric noise masking a longer-range signal.</li>
                <li><strong>Altitude Independence:</strong> Correlation length is independent of station altitude. Across 360 regressions spanning global and latitude-controlled altitude quintiles, only 3.1% show p &lt; 0.05 slopes, consistent with the null. Across all non-degenerate fits, the median Q5/Q1 ratio is 0.97 (IQR 0.76–1.27; 10–90% range 0.56–1.71), indicating that low-altitude (thicker atmospheric column) and high-altitude (thinner column) stations yield statistically similar λ values—consistent with TEP’s prediction that km-scale altitude variations are negligible compared to planetary-scale gravitational potential gradients.</li>
                <li><strong>Ionofree Phase λ ≈ CODE (2024):</strong> The 2024 OPTIMAL_100 Ionofree pos_jitter/phase alignment yields <em>λ = 4,767 ± 835 km</em>, statistically consistent with CODE's 25-year benchmark (4,201 ± 1,967 km). Year-over-year values increase from 2022 (2,521 km) → 2023 (3,959 km) → 2024 (4,767 km), linking raw SPP and PPP analyses under reduced ionospheric delay.</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Stability:</strong> Across the full 72-channel year-by-year grid (3 filters × 4 modes × 3 metrics × 2 coherence types), 66/72 channels have year-to-year CV &lt; 20% (most &lt; 10%). The remaining variability is concentrated in pos_jitter/phase_alignment under ionofree and precise processing, consistent with long-range sensitivity and environmental screening rather than a transient artifact.</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly Anisotropy Consistency:</strong> E-W > N-S detected in 94–100% of all 36 months across all processing modes (p = 1.5 × 10<sup>−11</sup> for 36/36). Multi-GNSS shows strongest monthly effect (coherence ratio 1.046, phase alignment 1.279). Short-distance ratios show CV = 0.7–1.0% (coherence) and 3–6% (phase alignment)—indicating the underlying signal is constant. The orbital velocity coupling (r = −0.509 to −0.763) derives from full-distance λ ratios, which include atmospheric screening effects that modulate annually. This distinction supports the "Screened Signal Model."</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal Stability:</strong> Comprehensive seasonal stratification reveals three complementary signatures: (1) "Summer Enhancement" (OPTIMAL_100/Ionofree: λ = 6060 km; Precise: λ = 6259 km), (2) "Invariant Core" (DYNAMIC_50/Multi-GNSS: λ = 1700–1900 km, Δ &lt; 13%), and (3) "Network-wide Baseline" (ALL_STATIONS: Δ &lt; 8%). The signal is not a seasonal artifact—it is a stable gravitational phenomenon variably screened by the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Null Tests Passed:</strong> Comprehensive validation across 72 combinations constrains several alternative explanations: (1) Solar rotation shows zero correlation (r &lt; 0.09 for all 72 tests), (2) Lunar tides show zero correlation (r &lt; 0.11), (3) Shuffle test demonstrates real structure (average R² ratio of 30× between real and shuffled data, min 1.9×). These results are less consistent with solar, lunar, or purely random-noise explanations.</li>
                <li><strong>Metric Complementarity:</strong> MSC excels at detecting temporal modulation (orbital coupling: 3.0–4.2σ), while phase alignment excels at spatial structure (anisotropy: 1.35 ratio) and achieves strongest orbital coupling (5.4σ)—both are needed for complete characterization.</li>
                <li><strong>Planetary Event Modulation:</strong> Year-specific coherence modulation detected around 37 planetary conjunction/opposition events with 2.8× higher detection rates than permutation null controls (p &lt; 0.001 for all 6 metrics). Mass scaling analysis rules out tidal mechanism: no consistent positive GM/r² scaling across 6 channels (5/6 show p > 0.49, 1/6 shows anticorrelation opposite to tidal prediction), indicating a non-tidal, threshold-dependent or geometric mechanism distinct from classical tidal forces. Detection rates of 59–68% vs. 20–26% null rate. No <em>consistent tidal</em> GM/r² scaling is observed: clock-amplitude vs GM/r² is non-significant (p = 0.647), and σ-level vs GM/r² is non-significant across channels (p = 0.317–0.989). One channel (clock_bias/phase) shows an anticorrelation in |coherence modulation| vs GM/r² (p = 0.0099), opposite the tidal expectation and not reproduced across the other metrics. Clock Drift MSC shows highest sensitivity (mean σ = 4.25). Independently replicates and strengthens CODE 25-year longspan findings.</li>
                <li><strong>CMB Frame Alignment:</strong> Comprehensive 72-combination full-sky grid search yields results consistent with the CODE 25-year benchmark. The Multi-GNSS/Pos_Jitter/Phase combination produces a best-fit vector (RA=188°, Dec=−5°) that is statistically indistinguishable from the CODE reference (RA=186°, Dec=−4°), with a separation of just 20.0° from the CMB dipole. Quality filtering confirms the signal is physical: the Dynamic-50 subset (daily files with clock std &lt; 50 ns) boosts the correlation to r = 0.660 (vs. typical r ≈ 0.51), confirming the signal is an underlying high-fidelity feature of the raw data, not a processing artifact.</li>
                <li><strong>Large-Scale Dataset:</strong> 1.17 billion pair-samples analyzed across all filters (713M ALL_STATIONS + 426M DYNAMIC_50 + 28M OPTIMAL_100), t-statistics up to 112, Cohen's d up to 0.304.</li>

            <h3 style="color: #220126; margin-top: 0;">Significance of Results</h3>
            <p>The detection of TEP signatures in raw RINEX data, processed with only broadcast ephemerides, addresses a key alternative hypothesis: that TEP signals are artifacts of precise product generation.</p>
            
            <p>By analyzing the fundamental observables to the rawest observables, this analysis shows that the signal is not evidently a fragile artifact of sophisticated processing, but a robust feature of the data itself—a baseline correlation that remains under conservative preprocessing.</p>
            
            <p>This represents a third complementary line of evidence for TEP:</p>
            <ol style="line-height: 1.6; margin: 10px 0;">
                <li><strong>Paper 1:</strong> Multi-center validation (CODE, ESA, IGS) — supports the interpretation that the signal is not center-specific</li>
                <li><strong>Paper 2:</strong> 25-year CODE analysis — supports temporal persistence within the analyzed interval</li>
                <li><strong>Paper 3 (This Paper):</strong> Raw RINEX validation — supports the interpretation that the signal is not solely a processing artifact</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Together, these three complementary analyses provide consistent evidence for distance-structured correlations in GNSS clock measurements. Independent replication by external research groups remains essential to assess programme-specific systematics.</p>

            <p>This paper provides raw-data validation of TEP signatures. The unified signature of spacetime symmetry, CMB alignment, and orbital velocity dependence suggests that the observed correlations may not be purely instrumental, but could reflect a coupling between clocks and the spacetime metric through which Earth moves. The observed breakdown of global simultaneity (CMB alignment) is consistent with the Bi-Metric Geometry framework (Smawfield, 2025), which preserves local Lorentz invariance while predicting global path-dependent synchronization.</p>
