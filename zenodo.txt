This study validates Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) signatures using raw RINEX observations and Single Point Positioning (SPP), analyzing 440 globally distributed stations over 3 years (2022-2024; 172 million station pairs). As the capstone of the TEP-GNSS trilogy, this work addresses the critical question of whether previously observed correlations are artifacts of precise post-processing (PPP). By processing raw pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements with only broadcast ephemerides, this analysis demonstrates that TEP signatures exist in the fundamental unprocessed GNSS observables.

The primary contribution is the robust detection of distance-structured correlations in raw data that match the 25-year benchmark established in Paper 2. Key findings include: (1) exponential decay with correlation lengths lambda = 727-1,072 km (R2 > 0.97); (2) directional anisotropy where East-West correlations exceed North-South by 2-5% (MSC) to 15-28% (Phase Alignment) at short distances (p < 10^-300); and (3) a geometry-corrected anisotropy ratio of 1.79-1.86, agreeing with CODE's reference value (2.16) within 17%. The signal is detected across three independent processing modes - GPS L1, dual-frequency ionofree, and multi-GNSS - ruling out ionospheric or constellation-specific artifacts.

Crucially, the anisotropy exhibits a "Seasonal Breathing" pattern. While the global average ratio is ~0.95 (masked by solstice troughs), the signal emerges strongly during equinox months, with E-W/N-S ratios peaking at 1.35-1.51 in April/September. This systematic oscillation explains the apparent inconsistency in static averages and supports a geometric coupling mechanism.

Four critical physical signatures validate the signal's origin:

Orbital Velocity Coupling: The anisotropy ratio anti-correlates with Earth's orbital velocity (r = -0.752, 5.3 sigma), independently replicating CODE's 25-year finding.
CMB Frame Alignment: A full-sky grid search identifies a preferred direction at RA = 157 deg, Dec = +9 deg (19.3 deg from the CMB dipole), matching CODE's benchmark (18.2 deg) and statistically excluding the Solar Apex.
Spacetime Symmetry: Position jitter and clock bias exhibit identical orbital coupling (Delta = 2-13%), consistent with a spacetime metric fluctuation rather than a purely temporal clock error.
Planetary Modulation: Coherence modulation is detected around 37 planetary events with 2.1x higher significance than null controls, but with no mass scaling (p = 0.457), ruling out direct tidal forcing in favor of geometric alignment.

Comprehensive validation tests confirm the signal is not environmental. It persists under geomagnetic storms with invariant structure (Delta lambda < 4%), appears in both hemispheres with identical polarity (NH 1.200, SH 1.348), and is stable across seasons (Delta < 6%). Null tests show zero correlation with solar rotation (27-day) and lunar tides (29.5-day), while shuffle tests confirm the structure is non-random (33x evidence ratio). The signal survives ionospheric removal, is network-wide (filter-independent), and exhibits a unified physical signature consistent with gravitational coupling to the cosmic rest frame.
