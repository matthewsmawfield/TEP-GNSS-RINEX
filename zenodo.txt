This study validates Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) signatures using raw RINEX observations and Single Point Positioning (SPP), analyzing 539 globally distributed stations over 3 years (2022-2024; 1.17 billion station pair-samples). As the capstone of the TEP-GNSS trilogy, this work addresses the critical question of whether previously observed correlations are artifacts of precise post-processing (PPP). By processing raw pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements with only broadcast ephemerides, this analysis demonstrates that TEP signatures exist in the fundamental unprocessed GNSS observables.

The primary contribution is the robust detection of distance-structured correlations in raw data that match the 25-year benchmark established in Paper 2. Key findings include: (1) exponential decay with correlation lengths lambda = 727-1,072 km (R2 > 0.97); (2) directional anisotropy where East-West correlations exceed North-South by 3.3% (MSC) to 22.4% (Phase Alignment) at short distances (<500 km, p < 10^-15); and (3) a geometry-corrected anisotropy ratio of 1.80-1.86, agreeing with CODE's reference value (2.16) within 17%. The signal is detected across three independent processing modes - GPS L1, dual-frequency ionofree, and multi-GNSS - ruling out ionospheric or constellation-specific artifacts.

The short-distance anisotropy is temporally stable, with E-W > N-S detected in 94-100% of all 36 months across all processing modes (p = 1.5 × 10^-11 for 36/36 months). Monthly coefficient of variation is 0.7-1.0% for coherence metrics and 3-6% for phase alignment, indicating the underlying signal is constant while full-distance ratios show orbital velocity coupling.

Four critical physical signatures validate the signal's origin:

Orbital Velocity Coupling: The anisotropy ratio anti-correlates with Earth's orbital velocity (r = -0.763, 5.4 sigma), independently replicating CODE's 25-year finding (r = -0.888, 5.1 sigma).
CMB Frame Alignment: A comprehensive 72-combination full-sky grid search identifies a best-fit direction at RA = 188 deg, Dec = -5 deg (20.0 deg from the CMB dipole), matching CODE's 25-year benchmark (18.2 deg). Solar Apex is disfavored (86.5 deg separation, 4.3x farther, 32x worse variance explained). Aggressive quality filtering (Dynamic-50) boosts correlation to r = 0.660, confirming the signal is physical.
Spacetime Symmetry: Position jitter and clock bias exhibit similar orbital coupling (Delta ≈ 5%), consistent with a spacetime metric fluctuation rather than a purely temporal clock error.
Planetary Modulation: Coherence modulation is detected around 37 planetary events with 2.8x higher detection rates than null controls (p < 0.001 for all 6 metrics), but with no tidal GM/r² scaling (5/6 channels p > 0.49, 1/6 shows anticorrelation opposite to tidal prediction), ruling out direct tidal forcing in favor of geometric alignment.

Comprehensive validation tests confirm the signal is not environmental. It persists under geomagnetic storms with invariant structure (Kp<3 vs Kp≥3: median Delta lambda ≈ -1%, 60/72 tests within ±5%), appears in both hemispheres with identical polarity (NH 1.224, SH 1.348), and is temporally stable (66/72 channels have year-to-year CV < 20%). Null tests show zero correlation with solar rotation (27-day, all r < 0.09) and lunar tides (29.5-day, all r < 0.11), while shuffle tests confirm the structure is non-random (33x evidence ratio, R² = 0.945 vs 0.029). The signal survives ionospheric removal, is network-wide (filter-independent with CV < 15%), and exhibits a unified physical signature consistent with gravitational coupling to the cosmic rest frame.
